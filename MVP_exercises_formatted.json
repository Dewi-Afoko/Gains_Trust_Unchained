This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.\nwhen lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.\na neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body.

Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nunlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations.

This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nthe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up.

    "description": "First get into the four-footed stance. The hands are underneath the shoulders. The fingers are fanned out wide and ensure a stable stance. It is best to rest your front body weight on your thumbs and index fingers. Now place your legs hip-width apart on the yoga mat. Your thighs should be vertically below your hips. Make sure that your weight is evenly distributed between your hands and knees. Your head is an extension of your spine and you are looking down at your mat. Your back is in a neutral position. Breathe in deeply and start with the cat. With the next exhalation, round your back vertebra by vertebra. Try to pull yourself as far as possible towards the ceiling. Pull your head towards your chest and tilt your pelvis. Now inhale deeply and move into the opposite position, cow pose. Bend your back down, pull your shoulders back slightly and lift your head as far as is comfortable for you. Your gaze is directed upwards. Breathe out consciously and switch back to the cat. With the next exhalation, switch back to cow. Repeat the exercise a few times and make sure that you are in the flow.",
