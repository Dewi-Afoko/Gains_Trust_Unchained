Backend and API built to MVP standard
Automated testing for views and serializers, ~100%~ pretty good coverage... I think? I'll be honest, haven't run coverage since work on the MVP frontend started and I began making hacky backend API endpoints! ðŸ˜…

MVP frontend built, gonna go and add tests for everything in the backend, then we migrate the data from HyPrOps and deploy!
